&lt;p&gt;Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in
the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of
years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European
colonists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jill</name></author><category term="Web Programming" /><summary type="html">An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bananas</title><link href="/mye785c83.github.io/as818/2018/08/20/bananas.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bananas" /><published>2018-08-20T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2018-08-20T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>/mye785c83.github.io/as818/2018/08/20/bananas</id><content type="html" xml:base="/mye785c83.github.io/as818/2018/08/20/bananas.html">&lt;p&gt;A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds

&lt;p&gt;In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called “plantains”,
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jill</name></author><category term="AS818" /><summary type="html">A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bananas2</title><link href="/mye785c83.github.io/as818/2018/08/20/bananas2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bananas2" /><published>2018-08-20T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2018-08-20T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>/mye785c83.github.io/as818/2018/08/20/bananas2</id><content type="html" xml:base="/mye785c83.github.io/as818/2018/08/20/bananas2.html">&lt;p&gt;A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds
